## Ba-sp.in

This pseudo is based on `Ba-sp-high.in` of the official PD table.
It uses the neutral ground-state as reference configuration but, unlike the official PD version,
it includes two projectors for the f-channel in order to improve the logder.

According to oncvpsp, the cutoff should be around 30 Ha but I would suggest to increase these value
by let's say 10 Ha to be on the safe side.

Hopefully, this version will give better results than the previous version, especially in covalent-like
configurations.
