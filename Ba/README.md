## Info

This pseudo is based on Ba-sp-high.in.
It uses the neutral GS as reference configuration but, unlike the official PD version,
but it includes two projectors for the f-channel to improve the logder.

5f is not bound in GGA-PBE but oncvpsp detects a moderately localized bound state
at small positive energy:

    WARNING wellstate: moderately localized bound state found for n= 5 l=  2
    WARNING scattering state with energy  0.05000000
    WARNING will be used for the first projector
